# OPA Policies

This directory contains reusable Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies written in Rego. These policies provide platform-agnostic security checks you can apply across different cloud providers.

- **AWS/Azure/GCP**: Generic rules for common misconfigurations such as public buckets or overly permissive IAM roles.
- **Helpers**: Reusable functions and libraries to build your own Rego policies.

Contributions and improvements are welcome.
