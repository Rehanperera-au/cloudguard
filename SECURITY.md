# Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in CloudGuard, please let us know as soon as possible so we can address it promptly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Do not** open public issues with exploit details. Instead, contact us privately so we can coordinate a fix.
- Email us at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with a description of the issue and, if possible, steps to reproduce.
- We will investigate and aim to respond within a few business days.

Please follow responsible disclosure guidelines and do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been resolved.
